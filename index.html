        <p id="ypietext">YPIE is a non-profit organization that focuses on allowing students enrolled in Yonkers Public Schools (YPS) to gain access to tutoring in education along with multiple programs, such as an Entrepreneurship program hosted by NFTE and a Science Research program that is endorsed by Regeneron (both of which are programs I am attending/have attended).</p>

        <p id = "allstarcodetext">All Star Code is another non-profit organization that aims to help Latinx and Black minorities, among others, learn to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The program has a great curriculum for teaching you to code, lots of projects to ensure you retain what you learned, and multiple "side events" that help you network and learn about other opportunities in the Tech industry. Some instructors are also mentally insane, so that's a plus!</p>
